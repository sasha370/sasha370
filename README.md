### About me
- I worked in the automobile industry for about 10 years (2006-2016). I started without knowledge or experience. As a result, I managed to become the head of the supply department and develop the road equipment service department from scratch.
- Since 2009 I have had a hobby of making all sorts of things from wood. By 2019, I developed this into a small manufactory and my company became No. 1 in the region. https://www.instagram.com/domik52.ru/
  During the pandemic, I had to close my business and switch to my second favorite thing - programming.
- I love practicality and functionality in things. I enjoy design and construction as a process. This is why programming attracts me so much.
