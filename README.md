### About me
- I have worked in the auto business for about 10 years. From scratch and without knowledge, he developed the service direction in the company.
- over the past 9 years I have grown from a hobby a small production of wood products. My company became # 1 in the region in 2019. In a pandemic, I had to close my business and switch to my second favorite business - programming
- I love practicality and functionality in things. I like design, construction as a process. This is why programming is attracted.
