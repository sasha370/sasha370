### About me
- My career began in the automobile industry, where I spent about 10 years (2006-2016) learning from the ground up. Over time, I progressed to become the head of the supply department and established a road equipment service department from scratch.
- In 2009, I started a woodworking hobby that I turned into a successful business by 2019, making my company the leader in the region. Unfortunately, I had to close the business during the pandemic, which led me to shift my focus to my second passion—programming.
- I’m driven by functionality, practicality, and the design process itself, which is why I enjoy programming. The combination of problem-solving and building things from the ground up is what excites me the most.
- Since 2019, I’ve fully committed to web development and haven’t looked back. I’m constantly learning and expanding my skills to build better solutions.
